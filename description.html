      <h2>About the Auto-Spotter</h2>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
        The Auto-Spotter is an advanced safety device designed for weightlifting applications, particularly bench pressing. 
        The system integrates an accelerometer, vibration sensors, and infrared pyrometers to monitor barbell movement 
        and machine health in real time. Using these inputs, the Auto-Spotter controls electric hoists to prevent unsafe lifts, 
        catch failed reps, and rerack weights automatically. This functionality ensures consistent safety and operational reliability for users.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
        The system is powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which processes sensor data and executes automated responses, 
        such as locking the winch or lifting a barbell back into a rerackable position. A wireless Bluetooth accelerometer 
        attached to the barbell tracks its orientation, speed, and position without obstructing the lifting experience. 
        With a durable pulley mechanism and robust safety features, including an emergency stop, the Auto-Spotter is designed to integrate 
        seamlessly into beginner-friendly gym environments while prioritizing user safety and equipment health.
